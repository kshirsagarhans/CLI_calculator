Welcome to my Command-Line Calculator project.

This is a simple yet powerful calculator built in Java that you can run right from your terminal. It can handle all the basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. But that's not allâ€”I've also added some cool features to take it up a notch!

Features:
Basic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
Advanced Functions: Need to calculate powers or square roots? No problem!
Memory Management: Save your results in memory, add or subtract from it, and clear it when you're done.
Continue Using Result: Want to keep using the last calculation? Just say the word, and it will become your new starting point!
User-Friendly: The program guides you through the options and prompts you for input, making it super easy to use.

How to Use:
Clone the Repo: Grab this code and run it on your machine.
Run the Program: Compile and execute the Main.java file in your favorite Java IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA).
Follow the Prompts: The program will walk you through the available operationsâ€”just type in your choices and numbers!
Enjoy Calculating: Get ready to crunch some numbers and impress your friends!

Feel free to customize it, contribute, or just give it a star if you like it! Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ˜Š
